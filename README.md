Project Overview :

The Image Slider project is an interactive tool that allows users to cycle through a series of images with smooth transitions, now fully responsive across all screen sizes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this slider enhances the user experience with automatic image transitions and a seamless, user-friendly interface that adjusts to any device. Additionally, indicators are included to show users their current position in the image sequence.

Key Features Automatic Image Transition: The images automatically cycle every 3 seconds, creating a continuous and engaging slideshow. Navigation Controls: Includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons for manual navigation through the images. Indicators: Displays small indicators to inform users of the current image position in the sequence. Hover Pause: When the user hovers over the slider, the automatic transition pauses. Once the hover ends, the slider resumes cycling. Responsive Design: The slider adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Infinite Looping: Once the last image is displayed, the slider seamlessly starts again from the first image. Technologies Used HTML: For structuring the image slider and its components. CSS: For styling the slider and ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. JavaScript: For implementing the core functionality, including automatic transitions, hover pause, navigation controls, and indicators. How to Use Open the image slider. Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to manually navigate through the images. Watch the images automatically slide every 3 seconds if no interaction occurs. Hover over the slider to pause the automatic transition; once you move the cursor away, the automatic sliding will resume. Check the indicators to know your current position in the image sequence. Customize the images by replacing the source URLs in the HTML code.
